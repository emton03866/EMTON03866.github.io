# About Me! :D 

Iâ€™m a product designer based in San Francisco, CA who loves to see thoughtful design bring people joy! Currently, I am studying UX Design at UC Berkeley's Master of Information Management & Systems. I recently graduated from UC San Diego (class of '22) with a degree in Psychology and a minor in Design. Most recently, I was a UX Designer at a food delivery startup called DormIt. I also have experience in product design through my time as a Design & Innovation intern at the San Diego International Airport (SAN).

When I'm not on Figma, I enjoy eating Viet food, watching cat videos, reading self-help books and hiking.
